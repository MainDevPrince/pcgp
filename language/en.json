    "second_section_why_description": "One of the most interesting features of giant bamboo is its unsurpassed growing speed. During the growing season, the shoots will sprout from the ground and reach their final length of up to 30 m height within a couple of months, with a maximum recorded growing speed of up to 1 meter a day. In fact, it holds the Guinness World Record of fastest growing plant.<br/>Although the common perception is that bamboo mainly grows in Asia, its growing area is actually evenly distributed around the globe. Giant species, which have the most potential for industrial processing and economic development, mainly derive from (sub)tropical areas, usually in developing countries or emerging economies.",

Bamboo is a collective name for a group of botanical species. Although the complete taxonomy is still evolving, current estimations are that around 1500 different varieties exist. There are considerable differences in size, colour, node distribution and configuration, mechanical properties and climatic preferences.<br/>Some giant species reach up to 30 m with cross sections of up to 30 cm per stem, whereas some sorts do not reach above 1 m in height and 1 cm in diameter. Depending on the climatic circumstances, there can also be a lot of variation in size and quality of the stems from the same species. Stems are larger in fertile, moist climates and smaller in dry sandy climates. ",

    "about_us_first_section_description": "The PANDA, our symbol as a powerfully cute BEAR. with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China. This bear also has a special significance for WWF because it has been our logo since our founding in 1961. Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs. A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter‚Äîabout 1/900th the size of its mother‚Äîbut females can grow up to about 200 pounds, while males can grow up to about 300 pounds as adults. These bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk.",
